## About Me

I’m a full-stack engineer and product-focused builder with experience designing and implementing scalable web platforms and backend systems. I focus on clean architecture, performance, and long-term maintainability, with a strong preference for solutions that are simple, explicit, and resilient.

My work involves building complex application flows, real-time user interfaces, search and discovery systems, and trust-oriented platform features. I enjoy working close to the problem space—translating real-world requirements into well-structured, production-ready software.

I value thoughtful system design, clear domain boundaries, and developer experience, and I’m particularly interested in systems that balance usability, privacy, and technical correctness.

## Technical Focus

### Backend
- Laravel (advanced architecture, queues, jobs, APIs)
- Livewire / Volt for reactive server-driven UIs
- Go for background services and system-level tooling
- MySQL / SQLite / JSON-based indexing pipelines

### Frontend
- Alpine.js for lightweight interactivity
- Tailwind CSS for scalable design systems
- Real-time UI patterns and progressive enhancement

### Search & Intelligence
- Typesense (custom indexing, facets, relevance tuning)
- Matching algorithms (psychological, lifestyle, preference-based)
- Structured data extraction and ranking logic

### Systems & Infrastructure
- Background workers and long-running services
- Windows services and tray-based applications
- Stripe Connect & escrow-style payment flows
- KYC, verification, and trust-based system design

## Philosophy

> Simple solutions scale better than clever ones.

I aim for pragmatic engineering: minimal complexity, explicit trade-offs, and systems that can evolve without rewrites.
